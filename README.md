# Quick Find: Machine Learning Business Proposal

## Project Overview
This project was completed as a data science group assignment. Our team developed a machine learning business proposal for "Quick Find," a mobile app designed to simplify product discovery using AI-powered scanning. The app enables users to find and compare similar products across major retailers like Walmart and Costco in real time. The goal was to integrate computer vision and recommendation systems to enhance the shopping experience through visual recognition, personalization, and automated price comparisons.

## Process Summary

### 1. Opportunity Identification
- Quick Find addresses inefficiencies in current shopping platforms, such as time-consuming product comparisons and lack of visual product search tools.
- Machine learning was identified as the right solution to power image-based search, personalized recommendations, and real-time product matching.

### 2. Data Requirements and Collection
- Proposed dataset includes product images, pricing, brand, category, warranty, and other key attributes.
- Data was categorized under four main types: Furniture, Electronics, Sports & Fitness, and Kitchen & Dining.
- Real-time image scraping from retailer websites was proposed for data acquisition.
- Ethical considerations such as privacy, image ownership, and fairness in recommendations were reviewed.

### 3. Model Selection
- Selected models include CNN variants: ResNet50, AlexNet, Vision Transformer (ViT), and a custom CNN.
- ResNet50 was fine-tuned and prioritized for its real-time performance, transfer learning capability, and classification accuracy.

### 4. Model Validation and Evaluation
- Models were evaluated based on image classification accuracy and efficiency in feature extraction.
- Structured product labeling and stratified sampling techniques were used to ensure balanced training data.

## Tools and Techniques Used
- Language: Python
- Libraries and Frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, scikit-learn
- Models: ResNet50, AlexNet, ViT, Custom CNN
- Techniques: Transfer Learning, Image Classification, Model Fine-Tuning, Stratified Sampling

## Business Relevance
This proposal outlines a clear and viable opportunity to use machine learning to transform the retail experience. By integrating computer vision and recommendation systems into a user-friendly mobile interface, Quick Find offers a competitive edge to retailers and an intuitive, time-saving experience for consumers.
